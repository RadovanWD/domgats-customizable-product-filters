## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the filter up and running on your site.

### Installation

1.  Download the latest release from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/your-repo-link).
2.  In your WordPress dashboard, navigate to **Plugins > Add New**.
3.  Click **Upload Plugin** and select the `.zip` file you downloaded.
4.  Activate the plugin.

## üîß How to Use

The plugin is designed for simplicity. To connect the filter UI with your product list, you need to do two things:

### 1. Place the Shortcode

Place one of the following shortcodes in a **Text Editor** or **Shortcode** widget directly *above* your Elementor Loop Grid.

* For your main products:
    ```
    [product_tag_filter]
    ```
* For your "add-on" products:
    ```
    [add_ons_tag_filter]
    ```

### 2. Configure the Loop Grid Widget

Select your Loop Grid widget and go to the **Advanced** tab.

1.  **CSS Classes:** Add the class `ahh-maa-product-grid`.
2.  **Attributes:** Add a custom attribute to link the grid to the filter.
    * **Key:** `data-filter-type`
    * **Value:** `products` (to link to `[product_tag_filter]`) or `addons` (to link to `[add_ons_tag_filter]`).

!

That's it! The plugin will now automatically control this grid.

## üîÆ The Vision & Roadmap

This plugin started as a specific solution for an Elementor-based project, but the goal is much bigger. The vision is to evolve **DomGats Customizable Product Filters** into a comprehensive, independent filtering solution for all of WordPress.

### Phase 1: Solid Foundations (Current)

* ‚úÖ Robust AJAX filtering for WooCommerce product tags.
* ‚úÖ Seamless integration with Elementor Pro Loop Grids.
* ‚úÖ Clean, extensible, object-oriented code.

### Phase 2: Builder Agnostic

The next major step is to break free from the Elementor-only dependency.

* **Integrations:** Add dedicated support for other major page builders.
    * [ ] Divi Builder
    * [ ] Bricks Builder
    * [ ] Beaver Builder
    * [ ] Oxygen Builder
* **Generic Shortcode Target:** Create a generic CSS class or selector system that can target any post loop, regardless of the builder.

### Phase 3: Standalone Powerhouse

This phase will make the plugin a complete, all-in-one solution for displaying and filtering content.

* **Built-in Render Engine:** The plugin will provide its own beautiful, customizable post grids, lists, and carousels via shortcode. You won't need a page builder to display your products.
* **Advanced Filters:** Move beyond just tags.
    * [ ] Filter by Price (Range Slider)
    * [ ] Filter by Category (Checkboxes/Dropdown)
    * [ ] Filter by Custom Taxonomies & Attributes
    * [ ] Search Box Filter
    * [ ] Rating Filter
* **Admin Settings Panel:** A dedicated settings page in the WordPress admin to manage styles, integrations, and filter settings without touching code.

### Additional Ideas & Suggestions

* **Multiple Filter UI Styles:** Offer different looks for the filter UI, like checkboxes, radio buttons, and color swatches.
* **URL-based Filtering:** Update the URL with query parameters as filters are selected, allowing users to share links to specific filter results.
* **Developer API:** Introduce a rich set of WordPress hooks (actions and filters) to allow developers to extend the plugin's functionality easily.
